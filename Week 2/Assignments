2.1
Write a class: “Student” with private data members: StudentId ( int), StudentFname (string), StudentLname (string ), StudentGrade ( char ) and public properties for each data member. Instantiate the class and assign data to properties. Display the data back on console.

2. Design a class hierarchy of your choice. (Need only class files )

(see Boxer Diagram)
Pet > dog > Hound (Beagle), Terrier (Welsh Terrier), Working (Boxer)

3. Overloading: Write a simple Maths class ( don’t use the keyword Math, it will be a conflict with standard class from system). Write overloaded methods with logic and give choice to user to call different methods :
a. Add(int num1, int num2)
b. Add(decimal num1, decimal num2, decimal num3)
c. Multiply(float num1, float num2)
d. Multiply( float num1, float num2, float num3)
Declare these methods as public and static.
