Mod 1 Basics

Assignments:

1. Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: x = 121

Output: true

Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

Example 2:

Input: x = -121

Output: false

Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

2. Write a program in C# Sharp to create a function to calculate the sum of the individual digits of a given number.

Test Data :

Enter a number: 1234

Expected Output :

The sum of the digits of the number 1234 is : 10

3. Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]

Output: true

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output: false

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]

Output: true

5.2
Mod 2
1. Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
Example 2:

Input: s = " fly me to the moon "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.

2. Write a program in C# Sharp to print the first n natural number using recursion.
Test Data :
How many numbers to print : 10
Expected Output :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

3. Write a program in C# Sharp to print numbers from n to 1 using recursion.
Test Data :
How many numbers to print : 10
Expected Output :
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

4. Write a program in C# Sharp to check whether a given string is Palindrome or not using recursion.
Test Data :
Input a string : RADAR
Expected Output :
The string is Palindrome.

5.3
Mod 3

1. You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1

Output: true

Example 2:

Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2

Output: false

2. You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?



Example 1:

Input: n = 2

Output: 2

Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.

1. 1 step + 1 step

2. 2 steps



Example 2:

Input: n = 3

Output: 3

Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.

1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step

2. 1 step + 2 steps

3. 2 steps + 1 step
