3. Write a program in C# Sharp to create a function to input a string and count number of spaces are in the string.
Test Data :
Please input a string : This is a test string.
Expected Output :
"This is a test string." contains 4 spaces

4. Write a C# Sharp program to accept a coordinate point in an XY coordinate system and determine in which quadrant the coordinate point lies.
Test Data :
Input the value for X coordinate :7
Input the value for Y coordinate :9
Expected Output :
The coordinate point (7,9) lies in the First quadrant.
5. Write a function which takes an array as input and finds the first occurrence of 2 consecutive 1s and changes their value to 0.

For e.g: Input : [0,2,1,1,9,1,1]

Output: [0,2,0,0,9,1,1]

3.2
1. Create a 2D array to store integers and print them in matrix format with proper formatting.

e. g:

| 2 | 3 | 4 |

| 1 | 4 | 6 |

2. Write a program in C# Sharp for addition of two Matrices of same size.

Test Data :

Input the size of the square matrix (less than 5): 2

Input elements in the first matrix :

element - [0],[0] : 1

element - [0],[1] : 2

element - [1],[0] : 3

element - [1],[1] : 4

Input elements in the second matrix :

element - [0],[0] : 5

element - [0],[1] : 6

element - [1],[0] : 7

element - [1],[1] : 8

Expected Output:

The First matrix is:

1 2

3 4

The Second matrix is :

5 6

7 8

The Addition of two matrix is :

6 8

10 12

3. Create a console application to overload “+” and “-“ operator for adding the areas of 2 circles and getting their area difference respectively.


4. Write a function that takes 4 numbers as input to calculate the total and average.
(Make use of params array to pass arguments and out parameters to return both total and average to main method).
Test Data:
Enter the First number: 10
Enter the Second number: 15
Enter the third number: 20
Enter the fourth number: 30

Expected Output:
The average of 10 , 15 , 20 , 30 is: 18.75
The total is 75

5. Create a function that finds the index of a given item in the array

Examples

Search([1, 5, 3], 5) ➞ 1

Search([9, 8, 3], 3) ➞ 2

Search([1, 2, 3], 4) ➞ -1

Notes

If the item is not present, return -1.

3.3
Windows form assignments

Use different controls on windows forms and change their properties (do not submit this assignment)
Create a structure : Student with fields like studid, firstname, lastname, address,monthofadmission,grade to hold character.
Create a list of students and perform following operations in windows application:

add new records,
delete record and
display them in grid.
Monthofadmission should be enum.

3.4
Assignments 3.4
Create an abstract base class to represent “Beverage” and inherit “Coffee” class from it. Create a list ( you may use List class) of coffees. Design windows form application to display the list of coffees in grid and perform add/ delete.
Keep some base properties in Beverage class which can be inherited in Coffee. Inherited class can have more specific properties. Properties are customizable as needed.

Week 3 Challenge Labs
1. Given a string, write a method that checks if it is a palindrome (is read the same backward as forward). Assume that string may consist only of lower-case letters.

Expected input and output

IsPalindrome("eye") → true

IsPalindrome("home") → false

2. Sum digits in string

Given a string, write a method which returns sum of all digits in that string. Assume that string contains only single digits.

Expected input and output

SumDigitsInString("1q2w3e") → 6 SumDigitsInString("L0r3m.1p5um") → 9

SumDigitsInString("") → 0

3. Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9

Output: [0,1]

Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

4. You are given a string s consisting only of uppercase English letters.

You can apply some operations to this string where, in one operation, you can remove any occurrence of one of the substrings "AB" or "CD" from s.

Return the minimum possible length of the resulting string that you can obtain.

Note that the string concatenates after removing the substring and could produce new "AB" or "CD" substrings.

**Hint : Use Replace method of string.

Example 1:

Input: s = "ABFCACDB"

Output: 2

Explanation: We can do the following operations:

- Remove the substring "ABFCACDB", so s = "FCACDB".

- Remove the substring "FCACDB", so s = "FCAB".

- Remove the substring "FCAB", so s = "FC".

So the resulting length of the string is 2.

It can be shown that it is the minimum length that we can obtain.

Example 2:

Input: s = "ACBBD"

Output: 5

Explanation: We cannot do any operations on the string so the length remains the same.
